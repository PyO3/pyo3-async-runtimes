//! Rust Bindings to the Python Asyncio Event Loop
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! This crate aims to provide a convenient interface to manage the interop between Python and
//! Rust's async/await models. It supports conversions between Rust and Python futures and manages
//! the event loops for both languages. Python's threading model and GIL can make this interop a bit
//! trickier than one might expect, so there are a few caveats that users should be aware of.
//!
//! ## Why Two Event Loops
//!
//! Currently, we don't have a way to run Rust futures directly on Python's event loop. Likewise,
//! Python's coroutines cannot be directly spawned on a Rust event loop. The two coroutine models
//! require some additional assistance from their event loops, so in all likelihood they will need
//! a new _unique_ event loop that addresses the needs of both languages if the coroutines are to
//! be run on the same loop.
//!
//! It's not immediately clear that this would provide worthwhile performance wins either, so in the
//! interest of getting something simple out there to facilitate these conversions, this crate
//! handles the communication between _separate_ Python and Rust event loops.
//!
//! ## Python's Event Loop and the Main Thread
//!
//! Python is very picky about the threads used by the `asyncio` executor. In particular, it needs
//! to have control over the main thread in order to handle signals like CTRL-C correctly. This
//! means that Cargo's default test harness will no longer work since it doesn't provide a method of
//! overriding the main function to add our event loop initialization and finalization.
//!
//! ## Event Loop References and ContextVars
//!
//! One problem that arises when interacting with Python's asyncio library is that the functions we
//! use to get a reference to the Python event loop can only be called in certain contexts. Since
//! PyO3 Asyncio needs to interact with Python's event loop during conversions, the context of these
//! conversions can matter a lot.
//!
//! Likewise, Python's `contextvars` library can require some special treatment. Python functions
//! and coroutines can rely on the context of outer coroutines to function correctly, so this
//! library needs to be able to preserve `contextvars` during conversions.
//!
//! > The core conversions we've mentioned so far in the README should insulate you from these
//! > concerns in most cases. For the edge cases where they don't, this section should provide you
//! > with the information you need to solve these problems.
//!
//! ### The Main Dilemma
//!
//! Python programs can have many independent event loop instances throughout the lifetime of the
//! application (`asyncio.run` for example creates its own event loop each time it's called for
//! instance), and they can even run concurrent with other event loops. For this reason, the most
//! correct method of obtaining a reference to the Python event loop is via
//! `asyncio.get_running_loop`.
//!
//! `asyncio.get_running_loop` returns the event loop associated with the current OS thread. It can
//! be used inside Python coroutines to spawn concurrent tasks, interact with timers, or in our case
//! signal between Rust and Python. This is all well and good when we are operating on a Python
//! thread, but since Rust threads are not associated with a Python event loop,
//! `asyncio.get_running_loop` will fail when called on a Rust runtime.
//!
//! `contextvars` operates in a similar way, though the current context is not always associated
//! with the current OS thread. Different contexts can be associated with different coroutines even
//! if they run on the same OS thread.
//!
//! ### The Solution
//!
//! A really straightforward way of dealing with this problem is to pass references to the
//! associated Python event loop and context for every conversion. That's why we have a structure
//! called `TaskLocals` and a set of conversions that accept it.
//!
//! `TaskLocals` stores the current event loop, and allows the user to copy the current Python
//! context if necessary. The following conversions will use these references to perform the
//! necessary conversions and restore Python context when needed:
//!
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::into_future_with_locals` - Convert a Python awaitable into a Rust future.
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::future_into_py_with_locals` - Convert a Rust future into a Python
//!   awaitable.
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::local_future_into_py_with_locals` - Convert a `!Send` Rust future
//!   into a Python awaitable.
//!
//! One clear disadvantage to this approach is that the Rust application has to explicitly track
//! these references. In native libraries, we can't make any assumptions about the underlying event
//! loop, so the only reliable way to make sure our conversions work properly is to store these
//! references at the callsite to use later on.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use pyo3::{wrap_pyfunction, prelude::*};
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pyfunction]
//! fn sleep(py: Python) -> PyResult<Bound<PyAny>> {
//!     // Construct the task locals structure with the current running loop and context
//!     let locals = pyo3_async_runtimes::TaskLocals::with_running_loop(py)?.copy_context(py)?;
//!
//!     // Convert the async move { } block to a Python awaitable
//!     pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py_with_locals(py, locals.clone(), async move {
//!         let py_sleep = Python::attach(|py| {
//!             // Sometimes we need to call other async Python functions within
//!             // this future. In order for this to work, we need to track the
//!             // event loop from earlier.
//!             pyo3_async_runtimes::into_future_with_locals(
//!                 &locals,
//!                 py.import("asyncio")?.call_method1("sleep", (1,))?
//!             )
//!         })?;
//!
//!         py_sleep.await?;
//!
//!         Ok(())
//!     })
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pymodule]
//! fn my_mod(py: Python, m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
//!     m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sleep, m)?)?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! > A naive solution to this tracking problem would be to cache a global reference to the asyncio
//! > event loop that all PyO3 Asyncio conversions can use. In fact this is what we did in PyO3
//! > Asyncio `v0.13`. This works well for applications, but it soon became clear that this is not
//! > so ideal for libraries. Libraries usually have no direct control over how the event loop is
//! > managed, they're just expected to work with any event loop at any point in the application.
//! > This problem is compounded further when multiple event loops are used in the application since
//! > the global reference will only point to one.
//!
//! Another disadvantage to this explicit approach that is less obvious is that we can no longer
//! call our `#[pyfunction] fn sleep` on a Rust runtime since `asyncio.get_running_loop` only works
//! on Python threads! It's clear that we need a slightly more flexible approach.
//!
//! In order to detect the Python event loop at the callsite, we need something like
//! `asyncio.get_running_loop` and `contextvars.copy_context` that works for _both Python and Rust_.
//! In Python, `asyncio.get_running_loop` uses thread-local data to retrieve the event loop
//! associated with the current thread. What we need in Rust is something that can retrieve the
//! Python event loop and contextvars associated with the current Rust _task_.
//!
//! Enter `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::get_current_locals`. This function first checks task-local data
//! for the `TaskLocals`, then falls back on `asyncio.get_running_loop` and
//! `contextvars.copy_context` if no task locals are found. This way both bases are
//! covered.
//!
//! Now, all we need is a way to store the `TaskLocals` for the Rust future. Since this is a
//! runtime-specific feature, you can find the following functions in each runtime module:
//!
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::scope` - Store the task-local data when executing the given Future.
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::scope_local` - Store the task-local data when executing the given
//!   `!Send` Future.
//!
//! With these new functions, we can make our previous example more correct:
//!
//! ```rust no_run
//! use pyo3::prelude::*;
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pyfunction]
//! fn sleep(py: Python) -> PyResult<Bound<PyAny>> {
//!     // get the current event loop through task-local data
//!     // OR `asyncio.get_running_loop` and `contextvars.copy_context`
//!     let locals = pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::get_current_locals(py)?;
//!
//!     pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py_with_locals(
//!         py,
//!         locals.clone(),
//!         // Store the current locals in task-local data
//!         pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::scope(locals.clone(), async move {
//!             let py_sleep = Python::attach(|py| {
//!                 pyo3_async_runtimes::into_future_with_locals(
//!                     // Now we can get the current locals through task-local data
//!                     &pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::get_current_locals(py)?,
//!                     py.import("asyncio")?.call_method1("sleep", (1,))?
//!                 )
//!             })?;
//!
//!             py_sleep.await?;
//!
//!             Ok(Python::attach(|py| py.None()))
//!         })
//!     )
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pyfunction]
//! fn wrap_sleep(py: Python) -> PyResult<Bound<PyAny>> {
//!     // get the current event loop through task-local data
//!     // OR `asyncio.get_running_loop` and `contextvars.copy_context`
//!     let locals = pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::get_current_locals(py)?;
//!
//!     pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py_with_locals(
//!         py,
//!         locals.clone(),
//!         // Store the current locals in task-local data
//!         pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::scope(locals.clone(), async move {
//!             let py_sleep = Python::attach(|py| {
//!                 pyo3_async_runtimes::into_future_with_locals(
//!                     &pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::get_current_locals(py)?,
//!                     // We can also call sleep within a Rust task since the
//!                     // locals are stored in task local data
//!                     sleep(py)?
//!                 )
//!             })?;
//!
//!             py_sleep.await?;
//!
//!             Ok(Python::attach(|py| py.None()))
//!         })
//!     )
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pymodule]
//! fn my_mod(py: Python, m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
//!     m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sleep, m)?)?;
//!     m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(wrap_sleep, m)?)?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Even though this is more correct, it's clearly not more ergonomic. That's why we introduced a
//! set of functions with this functionality baked in:
//!
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::into_future`
//!   > Convert a Python awaitable into a Rust future (using
//!   > `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::get_current_locals`)
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::future_into_py`
//!   > Convert a Rust future into a Python awaitable (using
//!   > `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::get_current_locals` and `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::scope` to set the
//!   > task-local event loop for the given Rust future)
//! - `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::local_future_into_py`
//!   > Convert a `!Send` Rust future into a Python awaitable (using
//!   > `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::get_current_locals` and `pyo3_async_runtimes::<runtime>::scope_local` to
//!   > set the task-local event loop for the given Rust future).
//!
//! __These are the functions that we recommend using__. With these functions, the previous example
//! can be rewritten to be more compact:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use pyo3::prelude::*;
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pyfunction]
//! fn sleep(py: Python) -> PyResult<Bound<PyAny>> {
//!     pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py(py, async move {
//!         let py_sleep = Python::attach(|py| {
//!             pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::into_future(
//!                 py.import("asyncio")?.call_method1("sleep", (1,))?
//!             )
//!         })?;
//!
//!         py_sleep.await?;
//!
//!         Ok(Python::attach(|py| py.None()))
//!     })
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio-runtime")]
//! #[pyfunction]
//! fn wrap_sleep(py: Python) -> PyResult<Bound<PyAny>> {
//!     pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py(py, async move {
//!         let py_sleep = Python::attach(|py| {
//!             pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::into_future(sleep(py)?)
//!         })?;
//!
//!         py_sleep.await?;

///
/// This function converts the `awaitable` into a Python Task using `run_coroutine_threadsafe`. A
